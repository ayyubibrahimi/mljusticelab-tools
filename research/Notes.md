# To-do

Workflow:

User uploads document to interface -> document is stored in IPFS -> agent analyzes document (ocr? -> summarize? -> classify as whether it meets smart contracts requirements (not sure how classification works)) -> if so, distribute token (and summary to user for why or why it doesn't meet criteria based on the docs content (citations come into play) )

# Bounties
1. There needs to be a spectrum of common / rare data. Can this be inferred from previous data? Yes. Need some groundtruth sources. 
   An example of common data could be data retrieved from a public records request (bar none, or is there a hierarchy within PPRS?)

2. Agent that can create bounties based on old leaks and current events
