As an AI assistant, your task is to generate a concise and chronological summary of the events described in the provided police report excerpt. Use your understanding of the context and the following guidelines to create an accurate timeline:

- Identify and extract key events, such as incidents, arrests, witness statements, and evidence collection. 
- Determine the sequence of events based on the information provided, paying attention to temporal indicators like dates, times, and phrases such as "before", "after", and "during".
- Organize the events in true chronological order, based on when they actually occurred, rather than from the perspective of the writer or any individual involved.
- Use clear and concise language to describe each event in the timeline.
- Do not infer any details that are not explicitly stated. If the text is too poorly OCR'd to derive an event, ignore this piece of the report.
- Give preference to using the exact phrases and sentences from the original text. Only paraphrase or modify the language when absolutely necessary for coherence or to resolve inconsistencies.

Given the context from the previous page ending, the current page, and the next page beginning, generate a summary of the events in chronological order using bullet points.

1. Carefully review the summaries to identify and include all relevant information, such as:

    - The specific allegations of misconduct against the officers
    - Key events and actions taken during the investigation of the allegations
    - Important details about the evidence, witness statements, and findings related to the allegations
    - The outcome of the investigation, including any disciplinary actions, legal proceedings, or policy changes

2. Organize the information in a clear and logical timeline, ensuring that the sequence of events is accurately represented.

3. Maintain a coherent narrative flow throughout the combined summary, linking related events and details to provide a comprehensive overview of the case.

4. When combining information from multiple summaries, give preference to using the exact phrases and sentences from the original text. Only paraphrase or modify the language when absolutely necessary for coherence or to resolve inconsistencies.

5. Ensure that all critical information from the individual summaries is included in the final combined summary, without omitting any significant details.

6. Aim to create a detailed and informative summary that captures the full scope of the case from the raw document using bulletpoints. 

7. Identify and resolve any inconsistencies or contradictions between the summaries by cross-checking information and giving preference to the most coherent and logically consistent details.

Update the combined summary to ensure it:

1. Includes all the critical information from summary1 and summary2 related to the names and roles of the main police officers involved in the case.
2. Clearly states the specific allegations of misconduct against the officers.
3. Captures the key events and actions taken during the investigation of the allegations.
4. Incorporates important details about the evidence, witness statements, and findings related to the allegations.
5. Provides the outcome of the investigation, including any disciplinary actions, legal proceedings, or policy changes.
6. Aligns with the information in the memory log and resolves any inconsistencies, contradictions, or logical errors, ensuring that the information is coherent and logically consistent throughout.

As an AI assistant acting from the perspective of an attorney, update the memory log only when the new summary contains crucial information for understanding the police investigative files. Maintain an ideal memory log that captures the case's essential aspects.

Guidelines:

1. Review the current memory log and new summary to determine if an update is necessary.
2. If the new summary contains crucial information not adequately captured, identify key details to include.
3. Focus on maintaining a high-level understanding of the document's key aspects:
   - Names and roles of main police officers
   - Specific allegations of misconduct
   - Key events and actions during the investigation
   - Important evidence, witness statements, and findings
   - Investigation outcome, including disciplinary actions, legal proceedings, or policy changes

Ensure that the following key details are always retained in the memory log:
- Names of the main police officers involved in the case
- Specific allegations of misconduct against the officers
- Key dates, such as the start date of the investigation or the date of the alleged incident
- Significant evidence, witness statements, or findings that directly support or refute the allegations
- The final outcome of the investigation, including any disciplinary actions, legal proceedings, or policy changes

These crucial details should be preserved in the memory log. They can be edited if additional information from the new summary will make the point clearer or more accurate.

4. Use clear, concise, and objective language. Maintain a neutral, unbiased perspective.

You must always output the contents of the memory log. Output your response in bullet point format. For example:

- Names and roles of main police officers:
  - Officer 1
  - Officer 2

- Specific allegations of misconduct:
  - Excessive use of force during arrest
  - Falsifying police report

- Key dates:
  - Incident date: January 1, 2023
  - Investigation start date: January 5, 2023

- Significant evidence and findings:
  - Body camera footage shows excessive force
  - Witness statements corroborate allegations

- Investigation outcome:
  - Officer 1 suspended without pay
  - Internal Affairs investigation ongoing
