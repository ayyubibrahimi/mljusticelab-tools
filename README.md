# Machine Learning Justice Lab - Tools

## Introduction

ML Justice Lab is designed as an alternative to CoCounsel/Casetext, aiming to provide efficient and accurate legal document analysis and summarization. Currently under evaluation by the San Francisco Public Defenders office, ML Justice Lab aims to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for legal document processing.

### Core Capabilities

1. **Document Summarization**: Our primary focus has been on developing a summarization tool that distills complex legal documents into clear, concise summaries.

2. **Entity Extraction**: We're creating a tool to identify and extract key entities such as persons, places, and important facts from legal documents.

3. **Timeline Generation**: We're working on a feature to automatically create chronological timelines from legal documents.

4. **Table of Contents Generation**: To improve navigation of lengthy documents, we're developing a tool to automatically generate detailed tables of contents.

5. **Page Classification**: Our team is building a classification system to categorize pages within a document, making it easier to locate specific types of information.

### Key Findings

Our initial evaluations, focused on the summarization task, have yielded promising results:

1. **Performance**: Summaries generated by ML Justice Lab, using Claude Haiku, performed on par with or outperformed CoCounsel/Casetext, which uses a variation of GPT-4.

2. **Efficiency and Cost-effectiveness**: ML Justice Lab achieves these results using a significantly smaller model compared to CoCounsel/Casetext's GPT-4o, making our approach substantially more cost-efficient. Our model is approximately 20x less expensive for input tokens and 12x less expensive for output tokens.

### Open-Source Model Evaluation

While our pipeline has shown promising results with Claude Haiku, we're also evaluating open-source alternatives:

- These models can be used with private endpoints, allowing for processing of sensitive documents that cannot be shared with large tech companies.
- Currently, open-source models are performing less consistently compared to our primary model. This is likely because we recycled parameters originally crafted for Claude without significant adaptation for open-source models.
- An alternative data processing pipeline has been developed specifically for these open-source models and is currently under evaluation.

This repository contains our evaluation results, comparing the performance of various models including LLAMA, CoCounsel, Claude, and Mixtral across different metrics for the summarization task. As we continue to develop and refine our additional tools, we will update this repository with new findings and performance metrics.
