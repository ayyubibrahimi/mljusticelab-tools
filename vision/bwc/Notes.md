# Goals

1. Can we identify the arrest (and all the metadata associated with it such as time, location, number of officers involved, victim, etc)
2. does it see the conduct leading to arrest,
3. how close it is to those two events (from far away, or in the middle of it),
4. does it start mid action (there’s 30 seconds of no audio at the start of every BWC. This shows when the officer turned it on)
5. Does the video owner shoot a firearm or throw punches / other violence
6. One thing we’re trying to figure out is how to quantify and compare the amount of time people are given  
to comply. There was a study a few years ago analyzing the language and tone of how stops begin and where that encounter escalates to. “Escalated police stops of Black men are linguistically and psychologically distinct in their earliest moments” (https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2216162120). So long term, we’d like to be able to tell how long in an encounter before the cop gives an order and then how much time they allowed for compliance before using force. Then ideally we’d be able to compare that to an average (taken from many other encounters).

 OOO:
 1. Identify which video/individual or individusla are primarily responsible for the UOF incident (first on scene, take down, arresting officer, etc)

# Qs:
1. What are the guidelines around them redacting audio?
