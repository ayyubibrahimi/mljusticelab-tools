# Flow

Stage 1: 
- Read the report. Determine the incident type, for example, an incident where pepperspray was used

Stage 2:
- Transcribe the BWC. 
- Based on the audio transcription, chose a time interval that likely corresponds with the beginning of the use of force

Stage 3: 
- Review the video for this time interval to determine if that is captured by our interval.
- For example, for each frame, use a binary classifier to determine if we can see someone being peppersprayed 
- If the interval is correct, we create a summary of the incident based on the audio, video, and compare it to the report 
- If not, step to a different time interval
